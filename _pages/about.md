I am an Instructor at [Princeton University]({{ site.data.links.Princeton.url }}) working with [David Gabai]({{ site.data.coauthors.Gabai.url }}). Previously, I was at the [University of Luxembourg]({{ site.data.links.Luxembourg.url }}) working as part of the research team of [Jean-Marc Schlenker]({{ site.data.coauthors.Schlenker.url }}). I recieved my PhD in Mathematics from [Boston College]({{ site.data.links.BC.url }}) under [Martin Bridgeman]({{ site.data.coauthors.Bridgeman.url }}) in 2016. 

I work in the field of geometric topology with a focus on geometric structures on surfaces and computational topology and geometry. Recently, I have been working on volumes of link complements in Seifert fibered spaces, circle packings on complex projective structures, classifying low complexity hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and geometrization of infinite-type 3-manifolds. For more details and pictures, please see the code and research tabs!
